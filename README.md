# Headers
**Headers** is a Python-based email header analysis tool designed to help security analysts, threat hunters, and incident responders quickly extract and visualize important information from `.eml` email files. It provides detailed parsing of common headers like `From`, `To`, `Subject`, `Authentication-Results`, and visually neat summaries of `Received` headers â€” highlighting the path the email took, with the closest hop to the recipient clearly marked.
